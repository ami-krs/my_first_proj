# Enhanced Factual Grounding System

This document describes the enhanced factual grounding capabilities added to the email agent to prevent hallucination and ensure responses are based only on provided information.

## üéØ Overview

The enhanced system includes multiple layers of protection against AI hallucination:

1. **Web Result Pre-Cleaning** - Sanitizes external data before use
2. **Factual Grounding Validation** - Validates responses against source content
3. **Enhanced System Prompts** - Strict rules preventing information fabrication
4. **Automatic Validation** - Real-time checking for potential hallucinations
5. **Conservative Fallbacks** - Safe responses when uncertain

## üîß Components

### 1. WebResultPreCleaner Class

**Purpose**: Pre-cleans web search results to remove potentially fabricated information.

**Features**:
- Removes IP addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, ZIP codes, dollar amounts, and URLs
- Extracts only factual content using pattern matching
- Preserves information that appears to be from legitimate sources

**Usage**:
```python
from ai import WebResultPreCleaner

cleaner = WebResultPreCleaner()
cleaned_snippet = cleaner.clean_snippet(raw_content, source_url)
```

### 2. FactualGroundingValidator Class

**Purpose**: Validates that AI responses are grounded in provided source material.

**Features**:
- Compares draft responses against original email and web snippets
- Identifies potential hallucinations using LLM-based analysis
- Provides confidence scores and detailed validation results
- Automatically modifies responses when hallucinations are detected

**Usage**:
```python
from ai import FactualGroundingValidator

validator = FactualGroundingValidator()
result = validator.validate_response_grounding(
    original_email=email,
    draft_response=response,
    web_snippets=web_data
)
```

### 3. Enhanced System Prompts

**Purpose**: Provides strict guidelines to prevent information fabrication.

**Key Rules**:
- Never provide specific addresses, phone numbers, or factual details unless explicitly provided
- Never make up company addresses, contact details, or business information
- Ask for missing information rather than guessing
- Use only information explicitly mentioned in provided sources
- Use conservative language when uncertain

### 4. Automatic Validation Integration

**Purpose**: Real-time validation of AI responses during generation.

**Features**:
- Automatic validation after response generation
- Modification of responses when hallucinations are detected
- Addition of disclaimers when uncertain
- Logging of validation results

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with Web Search Results

```python
from ai import analyze_and_draft_with_web_search

# Clean web search results and generate response
decision = analyze_and_draft_with_web_search(
    email=incoming_email,
    web_search_results=[
        "Company XYZ is located in New York. According to sources, they were established in 2020.",
        "The business has 100 employees and operates in the technology sector."
    ],
    web_source_urls=[
        "https://companyxyz.com/about",
        "https://news.com/profile"
    ]
)
```

### Manual Web Result Cleaning

```python
from ai import clean_web_search_results

raw_results = [
    "Company ABC is at 123 Main St, NYC. Call (555) 123-4567.",
    "According to reports, they were founded in 2018."
]

cleaned = clean_web_search_results(raw_results)
# Results will have sensitive information redacted
```

### Validation-Only Mode

```python
from ai import FactualGroundingValidator

validator = FactualGroundingValidator()
result = validator.validate_response_grounding(
    original_email=email,
    draft_response="Our office is at 456 Business Ave, LA, CA 90210",
    web_snippets=None
)

if not result.is_grounded:
    print(f"Potential hallucinations: {result.potential_hallucinations}")
```

## üîç Validation Process

### 1. Content Preparation
- Combines original email content with cleaned web snippets
- Structures data for validation analysis

### 2. LLM-Based Validation
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to analyze response against source content
- Identifies information not present in source material
- Provides confidence scores and detailed analysis

### 3. Response Modification
- Adds disclaimers when potential hallucinations are detected
- Maintains professional tone while being conservative
- Preserves original intent while ensuring factual accuracy

## üìä Validation Results

The validation system returns detailed results:

```python
@dataclass
class FactualGroundingResult:
    is_grounded: bool                    # Whether response is factually grounded
    confidence_score: float             # Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
    missing_facts: List[str]            # Facts that appear to be made up
    potential_hallucinations: List[str] # Specific claims not in source
    validated_facts: List[str]          # Facts that are properly sourced
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Pattern-Based Filtering
- Removes suspicious patterns (IPs, phone numbers, addresses)
- Preserves factual indicators ("according to", "sources say", etc.)
- Maintains content relevance while removing sensitive data

### 2. LLM-Based Validation
- Intelligent analysis of response content
- Context-aware hallucination detection
- Detailed feedback on potential issues

### 3. Conservative Fallbacks
- Automatic addition of disclaimers
- Request for missing information
- Professional tone maintenance

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for validation
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Model to use (default: "gpt-4o-mini")
- `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE`: Temperature for validation (default: 0.1)

### Customization
- Modify suspicious patterns in `WebResultPreCleaner`
- Adjust validation prompts in `FactualGroundingValidator`
- Customize system prompts for different use cases

## üìà Benefits

1. **Prevents Hallucination**: Stops AI from inventing details
2. **Maintains Accuracy**: Ensures responses are factually correct
3. **Professional Quality**: Maintains professional tone while being conservative
4. **Transparent Process**: Clear logging and validation results
5. **Flexible Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing systems

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to see the system in action:

```bash
python test_factual_grounding.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Web result cleaning
- Factual validation (requires API key)
- Integration examples

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Pattern Recognition**: User-defined suspicious patterns
2. **Domain-Specific Validation**: Industry-specific fact checking
3. **Real-Time Learning**: Adaptation based on validation results
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Validation in multiple languages
5. **Integration APIs**: External fact-checking services
